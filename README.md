# IncidentReportForm
Team project for Software Engineering course

This was a team project for my Software Engineering Course

The purpose of the course was to take us through a realistic scenerio of meeting with a client and then building a program from the ground up.

Our client wanted us to create an application that would allow for them to store digital incident report forms so that they could await approval from a higher up.

We chose to impliment this program primarily with Flask and mySQL for the backend and HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the frontend.
This project was an amazing learning experience about the process and assignement of resposibilities.

My responsibilities consisted of a bit of everything.

I made the initial mockup of our HTML form and then from there I implemented the original javascript to give a very brief demo on the frontend interface. Additionally, I assisted in database design and implementation. Lastly, I assisted in Flask as it was a new area that myself and the rest of the team were all interested in learning.
